    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>3/4 cup unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups light brown sugar, packed</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 cup evaporated milk plus more as needed
                depending on desired consistency</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>

    <h2>Directions</h2>    
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Add butter, brown sugar, water, and salt to medium
                saucepan and heat over medium-low heat, stirring
                until butter melts.</li>
            <li>Bring to a boil then reduce to a vigorous simmer,
                whisking constantly until thickened, approximately
                5-7 minutes. Keep in mind, the caramel sauce will
                thickens more as it cools. (If the caramel sauce still
                looks thin after you remove it from the heat, then
                return to a simmer.)</li>
            <li>Remove from heat and stir in 1/2 cup evaporated
                milk (it will bubble a lot) and vanilla. Add additional
                evaporated milk to reach desired consistency.</li>
