            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>

            <li>4 large eggs</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cup pecans, roughly chopped, divided</li>
            <li>3/4 cup Recipe Easy Creamy Caramel Sauce</li>
            <li>1/4 cup mini semi-sweet chocolate chips (may sub
regular)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Chocolate Frosting</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>6 tablespoons butter, softened</li>
            <li>1/4 cup + 2 tablespoons cocoa powder</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons light corn syrup (may substitute
                honey)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups powdered sugar, sifted</li>
            <li>2-3 tablespoons milk</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Directions</h2>    
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a 9×13 pan
                with parchment paper or aluminum foil so it
                overhangs slightly (so you can easily lift brownies
                out later) and lightly spray with nonstick cooking
                spray. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Brownies: In a medium bowl, mix together flour,
                baking powder, salt and cinnamon. Set aside.</li>
            <li>To a separate large bowl, whisk butter, sugar and
                cocoa powder together. Add eggs to the batter one
                at a time, beating after each addition just until
                incorporated. Beat in vanilla. Fold in flour mixture
                just until combined. Add 1 cup semi-sweet
                chocolate chips and 3/4 cups chopped pecans to
                batter and stir until just combined. Pour batter
                evenly into pan.</li>
            <li>Bake at 350 degrees for 30-35 minutes. Let pan
                cool on a wire rack for 5 minutes then poke holes
                all over with the back of a chopstick or small
                wooden spoon. Pour 1/2 cup caramel over
                brownies and spread into holes with a spatula.
                Refrigerate brownies for one hour or freeze for 30
                minutes to let the caramel set. Meanwhile, prepare
                the Chocolate Frosting.</li>
            <li>Chocolate Frosting: Beat butter, cocoa, corn syrup
                and vanilla in small bowl until blended. Add
                powdered sugar and 2 tablespoons milk and beat
                until smooth, adding additional milk if needed to
                reach spreading consistency.</li>
            <li>Once caramel has set, frost brownies with
                Chocolate Frosting (you don’t have to use all of it
                but I highly recommend it!). Sprinkle evenly with
                1/2 cup chopped pecans, 1/4 cup mini chocolate
                chips and drizzle with 1/4 cup caramel.</li>
            <li>You can serve immediately or refrigerate to allow
                frosting to set and make cutting easier. I LOVE to
                microwave my brownie serving for 15 seconds or
                so before devouring.</li>
